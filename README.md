💡 Project Overview

This Java console application demonstrates method overloading. Users can perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—using overloaded methods that handle different types and numbers of parameters.

The program is interactive, menu-driven, and includes input validation and exception handling.

⚙️ Features

Addition

Add two integers

Add two doubles

Add three integers

Subtraction: Subtract two integers

Multiplication: Multiply two double values

Division: Divide two integers with divide-by-zero handling

User-Friendly Menu: Guides users through operations and handles invalid inputs 



🏃 Installation and Running
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/thenakulcode/JavaAssignment2.git

Navigate to project folder:
cd JavaAssignment2

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Understand and implement method overloading in Java.

Apply object-oriented programming principles (classes and methods).

Implement exception handling for arithmetic errors and input mismatches.

Develop menu-driven console applications with clear user interaction.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Extend addition to handle three double values.

Include additional operations: modulus, exponentiation, square root.

Create a GUI version using Java Swing or JavaFX.
